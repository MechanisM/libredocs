- it's slow
- SignIn button is disabled
- in allowRemoteStorage state, the buttons are not visible
- setting browserid to true in step pop5 seems to not (always) work
- the 'check' on the browserid step covers up the 'First name' input and makes it hard to click
- the '<-' to doc list doesn't make sense when you're not logged in on a shared pad
- check the token in /squat/handler.js
- it's trying to connect to http://yourremotestorage.net/CouchDB/proxy/undefined.iriscouch.com/documents/pad:michiel@unhosted.org$1328977497529 and this gives a 500
